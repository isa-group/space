    # SPACE - Subscription and Pricing Access Control Engine

    SPACE is a pricing-driven self-adaptation microservice that leverages the iPricing and iSubscription metamodels to enforce feature-level access control in accordance with the terms of active subscription contracts.

    The API enables you to:
    - **Manage pricing for multiple services**
    - **Store and manage contracts**
    - **Enforce subscription compliance**

    ## Authentication & API Keys

    SPACE supports two types of API keys, each serving a different purpose:

    ### User API Keys
    - **Purpose**: Manage user accounts, organizations, services and pricing from the SPACE UI.
    - **Obtaining**: Authenticate via `POST /users/authenticate` endpoint with username and password
    - **Usage**: Include in `x-api-key` header for requests
    - **Accessible Roles**: `ADMIN` (full access), `USER` (access limited to own account and organizations)
    - **Access Pattern**: Can access `/users/**` and `/organizations/**` routes
    - **Example Use Cases**: 
      - Creating services
      - Managing organizations and their members
      - Viewing analytics

    ### Organization API Keys
    - **Purpose**: Perform programmatic operations within an organization's context
    - **Obtaining**: Created by organization owners/admins/managers via `POST /organizations/:organizationId/api-keys`
    - **Usage**: Include in `x-api-key` header for requests
    - **Accessible Scopes**: 
      - `ALL`: Full access to organization resources and management operations
      - `MANAGEMENT`: Full access to organization resources and limited management operations
      - `EVALUATION`: Read-only access to services/pricings and feature evaluation
    - **Access Pattern**: Can access `/services/**`, `/contracts/**`, `/features/**` routes
    - **Example Use Cases**: 
      - Programmatically manage services and pricings
      - Evaluate access to features
      - Manage contracts

    ## Organization Roles

    Users within an organization can have the following roles:

    | Role          | Permissions |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | **OWNER**     | Full control: add/remove members, manage API keys, update organization, transfer ownership |
    | **ADMIN**     | Nearly full control except cannot transfer ownership |
    | **MANAGER**   | Can manage members and services, limited API key operations (cannot perform operations on ALL-scoped API Keys) |
    | **EVALUATOR** | Read-only access to services and feature evaluation, can only remove themselves |

    ## Permission Summary by Endpoint Category

    All endpoints require an `x-api-key` header unless explicitly marked as **Public**.

    - **Public**: No authentication required
    - **User Key (ADMIN)**: Requires User API Key with ADMIN role
    - **User Key (USER)**: Requires User API Key with USER role (or ADMIN)
    - **Org Key (scope)**: Requires Organization API Key with specified scope
    - **Org Members (role)**: Requires User API key. If the key does not have ADMIN role, the user must be a member of the organization and have –at least– the specified role.

        **Cascading Operations**:
        - Renaming a service propagates the change by updating the corresponding `contractedServices` references in all associated contracts.
        - Updating `organizationId` triggers one of the following behaviors:
            - If contracts include **only the updated service**, each contract’s `organizationId`` is updated to reflect the new organization.
            - If contracts include **multiple contracted services**, the updated service is removed from them.
